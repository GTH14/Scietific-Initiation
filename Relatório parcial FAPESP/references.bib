abstract = {Most acoustic levitation techniques are limited to objects smaller than half the wavelength. To overcome this limit, different strategies have been proposed for suspending macroscopic objects in mid-Air. Two approaches to levitate spherical and non-spherical macroscopic objects have been recently presented: The acoustical virtual vortices and the boundary hologram method. However, the former approach places high demands on the available hardware due to the mandatory high switching rate while the latter uses a computationally expensive model that prevents future real-Time manipulation. In the present work, we demonstrate the single-beam levitation of a Mie sphere using a 2D transducer array. To achieve this, we employ a computationally fast sound field model based on spherical harmonics expansion. To obtain a suitable array output, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the stability of the sphere while keeping the net force balanced. In addition, we prove the local asymptotic stability for the equilibrium position and determine a domain of attraction using Lyapunov-based methods. In experiments, we show that the macroscopic sphere is stably levitated in a twin tuning forks trap, which results from a superposition of two twin trap signatures and a bottle trap signature. This result could open up the possibility of a computationally fast and convenient non-contact manipulation of macroscopic objects by a superposition of holographic elements in future applications.},

abstract = {Sound can levitate objects of different sizes and materials through air, water and tissue. This allows us to manipulate cells, liquids, compounds or living things without touching or contaminating them. However, acoustic levitation has required the targets to be enclosed with acoustic elements or had limited manoeuvrability. Here we optimize the phases used to drive an ultrasonic phased array and show that acoustic levitation can be employed to translate, rotate and manipulate particles using even a single-sided emitter. Furthermore, we introduce the holographic acoustic elements framework that permits the rapid generation of traps and provides a bridge between optical and acoustical trapping. Acoustic structures shaped as tweezers, twisters or bottles emerge as the optimum mechanisms for tractor beams or containerless transportation. Single-beam levitation could manipulate particles inside our body for applications in targeted drug delivery or acoustically controlled micro-machines that do not interfere with magnetic resonance imaging.},

@article{Andrade2018,
abstract = {Acoustic levitation uses acoustic radiation forces to counteract gravity and suspend objects in mid-air. Although acoustic levitation was first demonstrated almost a century ago, for a long time, it was limited to objects much smaller than the acoustic wavelength levitating at fixed positions in space. Recent advances in acoustic levitation now allow not only suspending but also rotating and translating objects in three dimensions. Acoustic levitation is also no longer restricted to small objects and can now be employed to levitate objects larger than the acoustic wavelength. This article reviews the progress of acoustic levitation, focusing on the working mechanism of different types of acoustic levitation devices developed to date. We start with a brief review of the theory. Then, we review the acoustic levitation methods to suspend objects at fixed positions, followed by the techniques that allow the manipulation of objects. Finally, we present a brief summary and offer some future perspectives for acoustic levitation.},
